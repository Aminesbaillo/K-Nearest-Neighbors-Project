# K-Nearest Neighbors Project

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying anonymized data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## Get the Data
The first step involves reading the data from the 'KNN_Project_Data.csv' file into a pandas DataFrame.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This includes using seaborn to create a pairplot with the hue indicated by the TARGET CLASS column.

## Standardize the Variables
To ensure uniformity in the dataset, the variables are standardized. This involves importing StandardScaler from Scikit-learn, fitting scaler to the features, and transforming the features to a scaled version.

## Train-Test Split
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.

## Using KNN
A KNN model is created to predict whether someone belongs to the TARGET CLASS or not. This involves creating a KNN model instance with a specified number of neighbors (n_neighbors) and fitting the model to the training data.

## Predictions and Evaluations
The model's performance is evaluated by making predictions on the test set using the predict method. A confusion matrix and classification report are generated to assess the model's accuracy and performance.

## Choosing a K Value
The optimal value of K (number of neighbors) is determined using the elbow method. A for loop is used to train various KNN models with different K values, and the error rate for each model is recorded. A plot is then created to visualize the relationship between K values and error rates.

## Retraining with New K Value
Based on the insights from the elbow method, the model is retrained using the selected K value to improve its performance.

This README.md provides an overview of the project structure and steps involved in implementing the KNN classifier for classifying anonymized data.
